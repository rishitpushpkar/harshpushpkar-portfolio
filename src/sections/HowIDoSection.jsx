        I begin by asking simple questions such as &quot;what,&quot;
        &quot;why,&quot; and &quot;whom.&quot; This helps establish the
        foundation for my design projects and better understand the needs and
        goals. Questions like &quot;how&quot; come later, once there is a
        sufficient understanding of the goal. Once all questions are answered, I
        explore possible solutions. This is where numerous ideas emerge. The
        ideas begin to take shape in the design process, in the form of working
        prototypes that mimic the actual product. However, the story is far from
        over. As we know, change is inevitable and necessary for refinement.
        Therefore, feedback is crucial at every stage of the process.
